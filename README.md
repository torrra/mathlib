# Math library

This was initially a school project, used for computer graphics as well as game development. It is used in my [3D puzzle game](https://github.com/torrra/spectrum-retreat-clone) as well as my early in development
[game engine project](https://github.com/TheIonProject/IonEngine)

## Features

### Vectors

Mathlib supports 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors and the following operations:

* Basic arithmetic
* Dot product
* Cross product
* Magnitude
* Normalize
* Rotation
* Projection
* Reflection
* String convertsion
* C++ I/O stream input and output

And more


### Matrices

2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices are also implemented in this library with:

* Basic arithmetic
* Determinant
* Cofactor matrix
* Adjugate matrix
* Inverse matrix
* Minor matrix
* Transpose

### Angles

Radian and Degree class are available for easier angle manipulations (conversion, wrapping). Vector and Matrix classes use them for rotations.


### Trigonometry

Cosine, Sine and Tangent functions are implemented in this library using the Taylor series (inverse trigonometry coming soon).  

### Arithmetic

* Round, ceil, floor
* Almost equal
* Wrap, clamp
* Absolute value
* Power
* Factorial

### Interpolation
* Lerp, inverse lerp
